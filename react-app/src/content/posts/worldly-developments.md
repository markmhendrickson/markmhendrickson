I'm happy to announce some exciting news regarding my startup. I've officially incorporated as [Worldly Developments](http://worldlydevelopments.com/) (yay for Delaware). Just a teaser of a website currently, but something I can print on my new business cards.

The reason for incorporation? I've raised some (micro-)seed funding from [fbFund](http://developers.facebook.com/fbFund.php). Since that requires a legit corporate bank account and the filing of other important paperwork, my mom has also assumed the role of Chief Financial Officer (employee #1! thanks Mom). 

FbFund isn't just an investment vehicle; starting this summer, it's also an incubation program in Palo Alto. So while I planned on moving to San Francisco earlier this month, that's been put off until the end of summer so I can enjoy the office space they've provided for us just off University Ave. It's one of the old Facebook offices, and all of the participating startups (~20) started moving their stuff in there just a few days ago.

From now until mid-August I'll be participating in the fbFund program, which basically means hacking away at my application as I would anyway, except with additional support/mentorship/resources provided by Facebook and others. I've already met a fair number of the participants and organizers, and I must say, it's a refreshing change of pace to work around like-minded people again instead of coding solo in my bedroom or at the cafe.

I also just got back from a quick trip to Japan and China as part of [GeeksOnAPlane](http://geeksonaplane.com/). Thanks to [Dave McClure](http://500hats.com) for bringing me along as a media partner of sorts (I relayed what we learned as a return guest writer for TechCrunch; see [these](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/14/geeksaplane-briefing-on-the-chinese-tech-industry-at-startonomics-beijing/) [posts](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/10/geeksonaplane-learnings-from-tokyo/) in particular). The people in the traveling group were amazing, both personally and professionally, as were the people we met along the way. If you haven't visited East Asia, I highly encourage you to do so.
