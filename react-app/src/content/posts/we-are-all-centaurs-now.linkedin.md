# LinkedIn share (draft)

Last year I used Cursor to ship a prototype as a non-engineer GM. It felt like a transgression. My team was skeptical. I spent months wondering if I had done the right thing.

The same pattern is playing out now for AI-assisted writing. A friend said one of my posts felt AI-generated. I felt the same doubt. Then I asked how I actually write: I start with questions, I work with an agent to analyze and draft, I iterate on structure and phrasing. The ideas and direction are mine. The words are often not. And I am publishing because I can do it in an hour instead of five.

The humanness is not in typing every word. It is in deciding what is worth saying. We are all centaurs now. The question is whether we do it with intention or with apology.
