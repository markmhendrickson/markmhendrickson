- Retrieval (embedding-based or agentic) infers; it doesn't guarantee. A truth layer is persistent, structured state: canonical entities, provenance, deterministic queries. It's about state, not retrieval.
- Two retrieval paradigms (pre-indexed similarity vs on-demand tool use) share the same limits relative to a truth layer: no persistent canonical identity, no provenance, no cross-session consistency, no cross-platform access.
- In practice, retrieval leads to incomplete recall at scale, irrecoverable overwrites, non-reproducible answers, no traceability, and unstable canonical identity (e.g. "Acme Corp" vs "ACME CORP" across sessions).
- A truth layer provides persistent canonical identity, deterministic merge logic, provenance and audit, idempotence, cross-platform truth, and a clear privacy model. Different design goals, not a spectrum.
- Retrieval can approximate entity resolution, timelines, and structured memory within a session but re-derives each time; a truth layer persists state instead of re-retrieving it.
- The choice depends on whether you need best-effort retrieval and orchestration or verifiable, replayable state. Retrieval excels at exploratory discovery and ad hoc summarization; a truth layer excels at complete recall, cross-session consistency, audit, and recoverability from bad writes.
