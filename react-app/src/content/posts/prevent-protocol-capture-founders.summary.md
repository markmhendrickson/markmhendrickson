- Protocol capture is when founders or a small group end up controlling what was supposed to be decentralized or community-owned.
- Define capture concretely for your context (tokens, keys, cap table, IP) and distribute power and value flows early so one party can't easily seize control.
- Make governance costly to capture with time locks, vesting, quorum rules, and public documentation of ownership and value flows.
- You can't prevent capture entirely; you can raise the cost and design so the structure doesn't rely on you being good.
- Credibility comes from public commitment to parameters and consistent follow-through when you change them.
