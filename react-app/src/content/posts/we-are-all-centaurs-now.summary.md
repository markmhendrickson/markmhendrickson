- Using AI to prototype and ship code as a non-"engineer" GM felt like a transgression in 2025, but that mode of work is now industry standard.
- Delegating low-level execution to AI frees you to work at a higher level: design, strategy, direction, and philosophy.
- The same cultural anxiety about authenticity is playing out for AI-assisted writing as it did for coding.
- The human contribution is meaning, values, judgment, and direction, not typing every word.
- Embracing the centaur model (half human, half AI) with intention beats doing it reluctantly or apologetically.
