Different design goals, not a spectrum.\n- Retrieval can approximate entity resolution, timelines, and structured memory within a session but re-derives each time; a truth layer persists state instead of re-retrieving it.\n- The choice depends on whether you need best-effort retrieval and orchestration or verifiable, replayable state.
