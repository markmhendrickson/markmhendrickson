- Neotoma is open as a developer release: a truth layer for persistent agent memory that AI tools read and write via MCP.
- You can run it locally with minimal config and no cloud dependency; the post walks through setup and verification.
- Raw input flows through interpretation into resolved entities, with full traceability and typed links between entities.
- You store files or structured data through a single entry point; corrections and re-runs preserve provenance instead of overwriting.
- The repo ships with schema evolution, timeline and graph querying, MCP auth, CLI, and tests plus health checks.
