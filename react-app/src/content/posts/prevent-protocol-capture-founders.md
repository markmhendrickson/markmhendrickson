Protocol capture is when a protocol or project ends up controlled by founders or a small in-group instead of by the community or the rules it claims to live by. It came up in a conversation about AI companies and funding, and it applies wherever you promise decentralization or community ownership. Here’s how to reduce the risk that you, as founder, become the single point of control.

## What you can do

- **Define “capture” for your case.** In crypto it often means token concentration, keys, or governance that one party can swing. In startups it can mean cap table and board control, or IP and decision rights that never leave the founding team. Name the levers that would let someone (including you) capture the thing.
- **Distribute power before it’s convenient.** Threshold designs (e.g. multiple keys, multi-sig, distributed validators) and broad token or equity distribution from day one make it structurally harder for one party to capture the system. Doing it later is harder and less credible.
- **Send value to the right place.** If the protocol or product generates value, flow it to token holders, contributors, or users according to public rules, not only to the founding entity. Design revenue and incentive flows so “success” doesn’t mean “founders capture everything.”
- **Make governance costly to capture.** Use time locks, vesting, and quorum rules so that seizing control requires coordination across many parties or long time horizons. Publish governance parameters and stick to them.
- **Accept that you can’t fully “prevent” capture.** You can raise the cost and lower the payoff. You can align incentives and make the rules transparent. You can’t guarantee that a determined, well-resourced actor will never find a way in. Be honest about that with yourself and with the community.
- **Commit in public.** Document ownership targets, vesting, governance thresholds, and value flows. When you change them, explain why. Credibility comes from consistency between what you say and what the structure does.

## Build for the worst case

I’m not building a protocol right now, but I’ve seen how quickly “we’re decentralized” turns into “the foundation controls the keys” or “the team controls the roadmap.” The only durable fix is to build structures that don’t rely on you being good. Assume you (or a future you) might try to capture the thing, and make it expensive or impossible.

Reference: the idea was prompted by a [shared thread on AI companies and funding](https://chatgpt.com/share/69931e04-92c4-8012-9389-83ab7aa1106b); the framing and recommendations here are my own.
