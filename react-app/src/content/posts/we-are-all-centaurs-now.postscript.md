A note on how this post came to be: I recorded a half-hour voice memo while lying in bed on a Saturday morning. The thoughts and feelings were most salient right then, and I captured them directly instead of waiting for a "better time" to write manually—a better time that probably would never have come. That recording became a transcript, which became the foundation for this essay, co-written with AI.

And about those em dashes you've been seeing throughout—I've intentionally left them in. Removing them to obfuscate that AI helped draft this would be like covering the tracks of someone I shouldn't be ashamed of working with. Besides, they're genuinely useful syntax for sentence structure, creating the kind of flowing, thought-within-thought pattern that mirrors how I actually think.
