# Draft Post Example

This is a draft post that will only be visible in development mode.

You can use this to preview posts before publishing them.

## How Drafts Work

- Set `"published": false` in `posts.json`
- Drafts are only visible when running `npm run dev`
- In production builds, drafts are automatically hidden

## Publishing a Draft

1. Set `"published": true` in `posts.json`
2. Add a `publishedDate` if not already set
3. The post will appear in the posts list
